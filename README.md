# wem-express
This is exercice 7.3 "Express.js Server" of the Web Engineering Master course. It's part of [WebEng21](https://github.com/marie-becker/WebEng21) but has been put here, to host the express server separately.
The source code and the application itself is shown in [WebEng21](https://github.com/marie-becker/WebEng21) as well.
